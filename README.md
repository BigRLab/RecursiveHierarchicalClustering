# RecursiveHierarchicalClustering
In this project, we build an unsupervised system to capture dominating user behaviors from clickstream data (traces of usersâ€™ click events), and visualize the detected behaviors in an intuitive manner. 

Our system identifies "clusters" of similar users by partitioning a similarity graph (nodes are users; edges are weighted by clickstream similarity). 

The partitioning process leverages **iterative feature pruning** to capture the natural hierarchy within user clusters and produce intuitive features for visualizing and understanding captured user behaviors.
